  <h1>NeurIPS@Cambridge Meetup  (8th of December 2023) </h1>
  <p>
    This is an offline and Cambridge-local meetup of the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference.

    Our goal is to bring students, researchers, and engineers from the greater Cambridge area (UK) together for an opportunity to meet and discuss machine learning research presented at NeurIPS. We also want to provide an opportunity for researchers to promote their work and meet people from their local community. The day will feature poster and panel sessions and in-person presentations.
